<p>
  Ho, ho, hello, <%= nickname %>!
</p>

<p>
  I'm here to deliver good tidings, the identity of your Perkele Steamy Santa
  <%= Time.now.year %> victim, and perhaps some, erm, <em>favors</em> if you're a good
  little girl and/or boy.
</p>

<p>
  So, to expediently arrive at the latter, let's get this out of the way. You'll be
  grif&mdash;er, gifting a poor soul known to you as <strong><%= victim.nickname %></strong>!
</p>

<p>
  Go forth now and purchase any <strong><%= victim.steam_platforms.join(' or ') %></strong>
  game on <a href="http://store.steampowered.com">Steam</a> as a gift for
  <strong><%= victim.steam_username %></strong>. Remember, you're trying to victimize
  <%= victim.nickname %> while keeping your wallet fat like the repulsive consumer you are,
  so try to find the worst torturtainment that Gabe will let you lay down five bucks for.
</p>

<p>
  To help you decide, here's a telling description of what <%= victim.nickname %> was wearing
  upon signing up:
</p>

<p>
  <blockquote style="font-style: italic;">
    <%= victim.wearing %>
  </blockquote>
</p>

<p>
  Yeah, I'm feeling it, too.
</p>

<p>
  Don't forget your promise, now: you are a victim, too, and once you receive your gift, it is
  your duty to play it for at least a little while and then tell everyone about how awful
  your experience was. There's no deadline, but try not to wait until Steamy Santa
  <%= Time.now.year + 1 %>.
</p>

<p>
  Okay, now that we've taken care of business, how about those&hellip; <em>favors?</em> Wait! No!
  Don't delete me! I have lots of fun toys in my sack! N-no-noooho-ho-hooo!
</p>
